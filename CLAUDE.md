## Core Data Types

The project uses shared TypeScript interfaces in `packages/types/src/index.ts`:

- **MarketSummaryData**: Market overview with Fear & Greed Index, VIX, interest rates, CPI, unemployment, S&P500 sparkline
- **StockCardData**: Individual stock data including price charts, fundamentals, technicals, AI evaluations, and news
- **AIEvaluation**: Comprehensive AI stock analysis with rating, confidence, and key factors
- **ChatMessage/ChatSession**: AI chatbot system for investment assistance
- **StockSymbol**: Limited to 10 target stocks (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, NFLX, AVGO, AMD)

## Backend API Endpoints

The backend provides these fully implemented endpoints:

```bash
# Market Data (AI Enhanced)
GET /api/v1/market-summary                    # Market data with AI Fear & Greed + Interest Rate Outlook
GET /api/v1/health                           # Backend health check

# Stock Data (Fully Integrated)
GET /api/v1/stocks                           # All 10 stocks with complete data
GET /api/v1/stocks/:symbol                   # Individual stock with AI evaluation + news + RSI  
GET /api/v1/stocks/:symbol/chart?period=1W   # Historical chart data (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y)

# AI Chatbot System
POST /api/v1/chat/sessions                   # Create new chat session
POST /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id/messages      # Send message to AI
GET  /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id               # Get session history
GET  /api/v1/chat/sessions                   # List recent sessions
DELETE /api/v1/chat/sessions/:id             # End session
GET /api/v1/chat/health                      # Chat service health
```

**Backend Testing**: Use `./test_endpoints.sh` to validate all endpoints. Requires backend running on localhost:3000.

**Backend Port**: Default port 3000, configurable via PORT environment variable.

**Service Architecture**:
- **Market Service** (`market/`): FRED API + SerpApi integration for economic indicators
- **Stocks Service** (`stocks/`): Google Finance via SerpApi for real-time stock data
- **AI Service** (`ai/`): Claude API integration for evaluations and analysis
- **Chat Service** (`chat/`): AI chatbot with session management
- **External Services** (`services/`): FRED and SerpApi client implementations

## Backend Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: All backend features are fully implemented including:
- Financial data services with FRED API and SerpApi Google Finance integration
- AI services with Claude API integration for evaluations and chat
- Redis caching strategy (24h for economic data, 12h for AI content, 6h for news, 1h for chat)
- Complete fallback system with comprehensive mock data
- All 10 target stocks with integrated AI evaluations, news summaries, and technical analysis

**Backend Service Architecture**:
- Market data refreshes automatically during trading hours via scheduler
- All endpoints have health monitoring and manual update capabilities
- Graceful degradation to mock data when external APIs fail
- News service includes AI-powered news summarization for each stock

## Frontend Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture
- Mobile and web apps share identical component APIs for maximum code reusability
- Chart components use Recharts library
- Mobile: React Native with NativeWind for styling (Expo ~53)
- Web: Next.js 15.4.5 App Router with Tailwind CSS 4.x

### Key Components (Already Scaffolded)
- **MarketSummaryCard**: Display market overview with AI-enhanced data
- **StockCard**: Reusable component for individual stock data with price charts and AI evaluations
- **StockPriceChart**: Historical price visualization
- **AIEvaluationCard**: Display AI analysis with rating, confidence, and key factors
- **AIChatbot**: Investment assistant (web: right sidebar, mobile: modal/bottom sheet)
- **LineChart**: Generic chart component for various data visualizations

### Layout Structure
- **Desktop**: Three-column layout (main content, watchlist widget, AI chatbot sidebar)
- **Mobile**: Vertical scrolling with watchlist in header dropdown and chatbot as floating button/modal

### Shared Dependencies
All apps reference shared packages via file: protocol:
- `@investie/types`: Complete TypeScript definitions
- `@investie/mock`: JSON mock data with utility functions
- `@investie/utils`: Formatter utilities for currency, percentages, dates

## Team Development Strategy

The project follows a "Vibe Coding" approach with phased development:
- **Phase 0**: Complete monorepo skeleton with shared types and mock data ✅
- **Phase 1**: Build Market Summary Card (first feature slice) 
- **Phase 2**: Create reusable Stock Card foundation
- **Phase 3**: Implement all 10 stock cards in parallel
- **Phase 4**: Add authentication and personalized watchlist management

## Required API Keys (Production)

```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key           # For AI evaluations and chat
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serpapi-key             # For Google Finance data via SerpApi
FRED_API_KEY=your-fred-api-key              # For economic indicators (CPI, Interest Rate, Unemployment)
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- All type definitions must be added to `packages/types` first (single source of truth)
- Use shared mock data from `packages/mock` for development
- Frontend components should accept typed props based on shared interfaces
- Implement responsive design using shared Tailwind/NativeWind configuration
- Chart components should use Recharts for consistency across platforms

## Workspace Dependencies

The project uses npm workspaces with local file: dependencies for maximum development flexibility:

```json
// Example from apps/backend/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@investie/types": "file:../../packages/types",
    "@investie/mock": "file:../../packages/mock", 
    "@investie/utils": "file:../../packages/utils"
  }
}
```

**Important**: After making changes to shared packages, run `npm run build:packages` to ensure TypeScript builds are updated.

**Package Build Order**:
1. `packages/types` - Must be built first (other packages depend on it)
2. `packages/utils` - Can be built after types
3. `packages/mock` - Can be built independently
4. Apps consume the built packages via file: protocol

## Current Focus

The backend is complete and ready for frontend development. Priority should be on building the MarketSummaryCard and StockCard components using the fully functional API endpoints or falling back to comprehensive mock data during development.

## Verification & Testing

**Backend Verification**: Use `./verify_be1_implementation.sh` to verify all backend services are working correctly.

**Full API Testing**: Use `./test_endpoints.sh` to test all backend endpoints with sample requests.

**Mock Data Updates**: Run `npm run update-mock-data` to refresh mock data when needed.

**API Key Testing**: Use `./check-api-keys.sh` to verify API key configuration and connectivity.

## Deployment

**Production Deployment**: The project is configured for Railway deployment with:
- `railway.json` for Railway-specific configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` for build configuration
- `render.yaml` for alternative deployment options
- Scripts: `railway-deployment-check.sh` and `wait-and-test-railway.sh` for deployment verification

**Environment Configuration**: 
- Backend uses `.env` file for local development
- Production uses environment variables through deployment platform
- All API keys must be configured in production environment

## Common Troubleshooting

**Build Issues**: Run `npm run clean` followed by `npm run install:all` to reset dependencies.

**Backend Not Starting**: Ensure port 3000 is available or set PORT environment variable.

**Package Import Errors**: Rebuild shared packages with `npm run build:packages`.

**API Connection Issues**: Check if required API keys are set in environment variables.

**Type Errors**: Run `npm run typecheck` to identify TypeScript issues across all packages.

**External API Failures**: Backend includes comprehensive fallback to mock data when external APIs are unavailable.
